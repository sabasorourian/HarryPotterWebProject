    <h4 id="1">History</h4>
    <p>
        Ravenclaw is one of the four houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as depicted in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Founded by Rowena Ravenclaw, the house is known for its emphasis on wisdom, intelligence, creativity, and learning. Here's a brief history of Ravenclaw:
        <br></br>
        Founding of Ravenclaw: Ravenclaw was founded by Rowena Ravenclaw, a highly intelligent witch, along with the other three founders of Hogwarts: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, and Salazar Slytherin. Rowena valued learning and intellect above all else and sought students with sharp minds to join her house.
        <br></br>
        Location and Traits: Ravenclaw House is located in one of the towers of Hogwarts Castle. The entrance to the common room is a door with a bronze knocker shaped like an eagle. The house mascot is the eagle, and its colors are blue and silver. Students sorted into Ravenclaw are known for their wit, curiosity, love of knowledge, and creativity.
        <br></br>
        The Sorting Hat: After the founders established their respective houses, Rowena Ravenclaw enchanted her diadem, or tiara, to enhance the wearer's wisdom. It became known as the "Lost Diadem of Ravenclaw." The Sorting Hat, used to assign students to houses, was also made by Rowena Ravenclaw.
        <br></br>
        The Grey Lady: Rowena's daughter, Helena Ravenclaw, is known as the Grey Lady. She stole her mother's diadem and fled to Albania to hide it. Eventually, the diadem was turned into one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Helena's ghost continued to reside at Hogwarts and played a crucial role in the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
        <br></br>
        House Traits and Reputation: Ravenclaw is known for its academically inclined students. They excel in subjects that require intellectual prowess, such as charms, transfiguration, potions, and ancient runes. Ravenclaws value wit, wisdom, and original thinking. They are often found in the Hogwarts library or pursuing intellectual pursuits.
        <br></br>
        House Founder's Portrait: The portrait of Rowena Ravenclaw hangs in the Ravenclaw common room. In the movies, the entrance to the common room is accessed by answering a riddle posed by a bronze eagle-shaped knocker.
        <br></br>
        House Cup: Like the other Hogwarts houses, Ravenclaw competes for the House Cup, which is awarded based on academic achievement, points earned through good behavior, and success in Quidditch matches.
        <br></br>
        Throughout the Harry Potter series, Ravenclaw students, including notable characters like Luna Lovegood, Cho Chang, and Filius Flitwick, play significant roles in the story, contributing their intelligence and unique perspectives to the wizarding world.
