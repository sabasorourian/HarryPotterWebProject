    <h4 id="1">History</h4>
    <p>
        Slytherin was founded by Salazar Slytherin around the 10th Century. Salazar valued resourcefulness, cunning, ambition, and pure-blood heritage. It is said that he left the school after a disagreement with the other founders about admitting Muggle-born students, leaving behind a secret chamber in the castle: The Chamber of Secrets.
        <br><br>
        Salazar Slytherin was a proponent of pure-blood supremacy who considered Muggleborns too untrustworthy to be taught magic. Slytherin's views at the time could be attributed to the persecution of witches and wizards at the hand of Muggles during his era.
        <br><br>
        Slytherin's opposition to allowing witches and wizards of Muggle heritage to enroll created great controversy at Hogwarts, and it became the root of a feud that would destroy his friendship with Godric Gryffindor. According to the Sorting Hat, their dispute would erupt into a duel between the two former comrades or a civil war between their students. Slytherin ultimately decided to leave the school when he was unable to persuade the other founders to join his side in their argument. The legacy of his feud with Gryffindor has continued in modern times with their two houses sharing the most intense rivalry at Hogwarts.
        <br><br>
        When Slytherin departed Hogwarts, he left behind the Chamber of Secrets with the purpose of an heir opening the chamber one day and unleashing a means to 'protect' the school from those who, in his view, were unworthy to study to magic: Muggle-borns. The chamber was opened twice and the Serpent of Slytherin was killed the second time by Harry Potter in 1993.

    <h4 id="2">Traits</h4>
    <p>
        Members of Slytherin House are known for their ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness. They are also known to have a certain disregard for rules. The house values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness.
        <br><br>
        Slytherins tended to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also had highly developed senses of self-preservation. This means that Slytherins tended to hesitate before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.
        <br><br>
        According to Albus Dumbledore, the qualities which Salazar valued in the students he had chosen included cleverness, resourcefulness, determination, and <i>a certain disregard for the rules</i>. Dumbledore noted that all of these were qualities possessed by Harry Potter, who was a Gryffindor but was almost placed in Slytherin.
        <br><br>
        Slytherins tended to take charge and possessed strong leadership skills. They were often self-assured and confident of their own competence and can be very loyal.
        <br><br>
        Another characteristic some Slytherins share was a tendency towards deep, unrequited love. Severus Snape and the Bloody Baron held abiding but unreturned feelings for Lily Evans and Helena Ravenclaw, respectively. Although some Slytherins, such as Tom Riddle, were incapable of feeling love at all, those that did were known to cherish their passion abidingly and unconditionally, although often tragically due to an inability to act appropriately on their feelings. Interestingly, Bellatrix Lestrange held feelings for Tom Riddle himself, which was a factor in her fanatical devotion to the Death Eaters; although Lord Voldemort was incapable of loving her in return, the existence of Delphini suggests that there was at least some kind of intimacy between them.
        <br><br>
        Although Merope Riddle likely never attended Hogwarts and therefore wouldn't have been sorted into Slytherin at all, she was a descendant of Slytherin himself and fit the pattern of those sorted into his house, as she held deep and unreturned feelings for Tom Riddle Snr, who often travelled by her house on his carriage.

    <h4 id="3">Reputation</h4>
    <img src="../images/Slytherin/rep.png" alt="">
    <p>
        Due to the number of dark witches and wizards Slytherin produced (including Tom Riddle), the house has a negative reputation. However, not all Slytherins are evil, and the house has also produced its share of successful and influential students.
        <br><br>
        Slytherin had a well-known reputation for creating Dark witches and wizards that many would even say that every Dark witch or wizard was actually in Slytherin (it also didn't help that Voldemort himself was in Slytherin too when he was a student at Hogwarts). While it was true that many were in the house, it was untrue to say every single one of them was, as Peter Pettigrew, betrayer of James and Lily, was in Gryffindor, Quirinus Quirrell was in Ravenclaw, and Cedric Diggory, who turned to the dark side in an alternate reality, was in Hufflepuff.
    </p>


    <h4 id="4">Slytherin Dungeon</h4>
    <p>Slytherin's dormitories and common room are located in Slytherin Dungeon. The entrance is hidden behind a stone wall in the dungeons. The common room looks out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. The common room is a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and round greenish lamps hanging from the ceiling.</p>


    <h4 id="5">Common Room</h4>
    <p>The Slytherin Common Room is a long, low, dungeon-style room, underneath the Hogwarts Lake, filled with skull-shaped lamps and greenish lamps. The room is described as having a greenish glow.
        <br><br>
        The Slytherin common room was in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle and underneath the Black Lake. Because of this, the light in the common room was green. Harry Potter along with Ron Weasley entered the common room in his second year to find out if Draco Malfoy was the one opening the Chamber of Secrets. To enter the Slytherin common room one must merely speak aloud the current password in front of a stretch of a damp stone wall; once the word was uttered a concealed stone door would slide aside leaving a rectangular hole in the wall leading to the Slytherin common room. The only known Slytherin password was "pureblood", used in 1992.

    <h4 id="6">Dormitories</h4>
    <p>The Slytherin dormitories are ancient, four-poster beds with green silk hangings, and the coverlets have silver-threaded designs. The walls are covered in dark wood, and the windows look out into the underwater vegetation of the Hogwarts Lake.</p>


    <h4 id="7">Head of House</h4>
    <img src="../images/Slytherin/headofslytherin.png" alt="">
    <p>The known heads of the house include Severus Snape, and later, Horace Slughorn, who was head of Slytherin House before Snape and after Snape became headmaster.</p>


    <h4 id="8">Known Slytherins</h4>
    <p>Notable Slytherins include Merula Snyde, Horace Slughorn, Severus Snape, Draco Malfoy, and of course, Tom Riddle, who later became known as Lord Voldemort.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Slytherin's Head of House for Harry's first six years of school was Severus Snape; however, as he fled with the Death Eaters in 1997 at the end of Harry's sixth year, Potions Master Horace Slughorn became the head of Slytherin House. Upon Snape's return as Headmaster later that year, he apparently approved of Slughorn's appointment, as he did not assign any Death Eaters as the new Head of House.</p>

    <h4 id="9">Etymology</h4>
    <p>Slytherin comes from the founder's name, Salazar Slytherin. The term Slytherin might come from the English verb "to slither". It is possibly inspired by the Old Norse term "slithering", which means "creeping".</p>
